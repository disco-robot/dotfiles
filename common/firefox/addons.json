When DownloadHelper detects embedded videos it can access for download, the toolbar icon highlights and a simple menu allows you to download files by simply clicking an item.\n\nFor instance, if you go to a YouTube page, you'll be able to download the video directly on your file system. It also works with most other popular video sites like DailyMotion, Facebook, Periscope, Vimeo, Twitch, Liveleak, Vine, UStream, Fox, Bloomberg, RAI, France 2-3, Break, Metacafe, and thousands of others.\n\nVideo DownloadHelper supports several types of streamings, making the add-on unique amongst Video downloaders: HTTP, HLS, DASH, … Whenever a site uses a non-supported streaming technology, Video DownloadHelper is able to capture the media directly from the screen and generate a video file.\n\nBesides downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also capable of making file conversions (i.e. change audio and video formats) and aggregation (combining separate audio and video into a single file). This is an upgrade feature that helps pay for the free stuff (we need to eat too). You are not compelled to use conversion for downloading videos from websites, and you can avoid picking variants marked as ADP to avoid the need for aggregation.\n\nVideo overview on how to use Video DownloadHelper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZT8yI60k_4\n\nSupport can be obtained from the dedicated support forum.\n\nPlease stay tuned by following us on Twitter (@downloadhelper), or Facebook.","weeklyDownloads":63811,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"mig","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/32479/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/25/25993.png?modified=1622132280","width":200,"height":150,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/25/25993.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":150,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154820.png?modified=1622132280","width":327,"height":124,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154820.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":327,"thumbnailHeight":124,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper animated toobar icon"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154824.png?modified=1622132280","width":250,"height":200,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154824.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":250,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154822.png?modified=1622132280","width":361,"height":289,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154822.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":361,"thumbnailHeight":289,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154826.png?modified=1622132281","width":320,"height":317,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154826.jpg?modified=1622132281","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":317,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper available actions"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154828.png?modified=1622132281","width":293,"height":250,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154828.jpg?modified=1622132281","thumbnailWidth":293,"thumbnailHeight":250,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper quality variants settings"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.2853,"reviewCount":13823,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/reviews/","updateDate":1670502520000},{"id":"addon@darkreader.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-32.png?modified=3f34e276","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-64.png?modified=3f34e276","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-128.png?modified=3f34e276"},"name":"Dark Reader","version":"4.9.60","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4021899/darkreader-4.9.60.xpi","homepageURL":"https://darkreader.org/","supportURL":"https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader","description":"Dark mode for every website.

the ability to disable JavaScript for specific sites or specific tabs.\nYou can customize the default JS state (on or off), the disable behavior (by domain or by tab) and much more.","fullDescription":"Introduction\nThis web extension lets an user decide if JavaScript should be enabled or disabled for a given host or a given tab.\n\nFeatures\n\n    Set the default state (JS on or JS off)\n    Set the disable behavior (By domain or by tab)\n    Use shortcuts (you can also disable this)\n    Use a context menu item for toggling (you can also disable this)\n    See your blacklisted/whitelisted domain list\n    Add domains manually before visiting a site\n    Add base domains that automatically enable/disable JS for sub domains\n\n\nUsage\nWhen accessing e.g. mozilla.org and disabling JavaScript, the web extension will block all JavaScript which otherwise would be loaded by mozilla.org (including inline JS and external JS files from other hosts).\n\nPlease note that scripts from the blacklisted host will still be loaded if they're being loaded in another host (unless you block that host as well of course).\n\nSupported browsers\n\n    Mozilla Firefox (Desktop & Firefox for Android)\n    Google Chrome (Desktop)\n\n\nWhy to use this web extension\nThe code is completely open source, you can also use the unpacked version of this web extension if you prefer.\nNo data of you will ever be logged and the web extension asks only for the permissions it really needs.\nPull requests are welcome!\n\nFuture plans\nYou can see existing and add new feature proposals on the projects GitHub page.\n\nOther web extensions\n\n    View Page Source (Mobile)\n\n\nSupport\nIf you need any assistance or find any bugs, feel free to contact me directly via email or create a new issue on the projects GitHub page.","weeklyDownloads":683,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"David Pacassi
