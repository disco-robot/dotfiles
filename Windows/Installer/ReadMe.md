# Instalation script

## Notes

You will have to run the script as administrator, but before that go to settings, and go to the developers options, which are under the tab Update and Security, there enable the option to run powershell scripts.

## Debloat

The debloat section in the install script will run a script from [this](https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater) repo. 
After that just have fun uninstalling bullshit from the startmenu.


## Extra

There is an option to set lockscreen and home wallpaper in the install script just uncomment it and set the wallpaper path.
